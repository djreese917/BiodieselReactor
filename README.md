# BiodieselReactor
GUI + Arduino code for the automated biodiesel reactor. 

# Arduino Libraries

Libraries necessary for the arduino code. If you don't know how to install arduino libraries, click [here](http://arduino.cc/en/guide/libraries).

## Arduino IDE

I strongly suggest using the [standard arduino IDE](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software/) for this project. Really easy to use. 

## Temperature Sensor Libraries

Download and install the "OneWire Arduino Library" and the "DallasTemperature Arduino Library" from [this](http://www.hacktronics.com/Tutorials/arduino-1-wire-tutorial.html) page. 

## Timer Libaries

Go to [this](http://playground.arduino.cc/Code/Timer1) page and download the TimerOne and TimerThree libraries. The timer one
library is on google code and the timer three library is a direct link. Doesn't matter though, you just need the zip files.

That's it in terms of arduino libraries. 

#Python Stuff

In order to use this code, you will need several arduino libraries as well as several Python libraries. Note that the python 
code is written with python 2.7.6. Any 2.x.x version of python should work though. Download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## PySerial

PySerial is awesome. [Here's](http://pyserial.sourceforge.net/pyserial.html) a page that has installation instructions.
Also, [this](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial) is a direct link to the same package I'm using. 

## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is an awesome mathematical libary for python that is used to do GUI graphing for this project. Click [here](http://matplotlib.org/1.3.1/users/installing.html)
and go to the "build requirements" section for installation instructions. Also, I'm using Matplotlib 1.4.2 and numpy 1.9.1 if you need that information.
Those versions or later should work. 

# Done

That's it, you should be good to go. Note that if you have problems, there's plenty of information on these libraries on the
internet. Thanks Internet.
